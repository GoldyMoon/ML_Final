## To run the program, please first use Reward_Model.py to train a reward model, then run the GRPO.py to fine-tune the pre-trained model. Update the reward model using re-wegiht.py. Evaluate the effectivness of the final LLM use the Eval.py

### Reward_Model.py contains the reward model training process

### GRPO.py contains the GRPO process

### re-weight.py contains how we re-weight the reward model

### Eval.py is the file to evaluate between two model(Base model and our model)
